\section{Introduction}
In this chapter, we discuss parallel strategy on BVD problem in meshes. A mesh of size $d_1\times d_2$ has $n=d_1\times d_2(d_1>2,d_2>2)$ nodes. Without loss of generality, let $d_1<d_2$ and let the node of {\em M} be donated by their column and row coordinate ($x_1$,$x_2$), $1\leq x_i \leq d_1$, $1\leq i \leq d_2$. Observe that in a mesh, we have three types of nodes: \textit{corner} (entities with only two neighbours), \textit{border}(entities with three neighbours), and \textit{interior}(with four neighbours). In the sequential strategy for meshes, an ``explorer agent ''and a ``leader explorer agent'' are sent to explore the graph and locate the BV. They traverse the mesh in a snake-like fashion column by column following the ``casual walk''. These strategies are simple to follow and result in least casualties. But at the same time they are not time-efficient. Now we consider that if more than two agents are allowed to participate in the exploring phase and we focus on decreasing the time cost in the exploring phase and the number of casualties, how to design a new strategy so that the we are able to reach the destination with acceptable cost (the increasing number of agents used in the exploring phase). Our strategy follows two phase: shadowed exploration and elimination. In the first phase, the network is traversed until the location of the BV is determined. That location is clear after the visit while all of its unprotected neighbours have become BVs. Actually, in our strategy, there are only one new formed BV. In the second phase, new formed BV is surrounded and permanently eliminated. There are two significant differences between our strategy and the sequential strategy: the number of agents employed in the exploration phase; the route of agents in the exploration phase. We also give the routes of agents in the elimination phase. 
\section{Shadowed Exploration and Elimination}
\noindent{\bf Shadowed Exploration Phase} \\
Initially, 2$d_1$ agents are placed at the first two columns at $T_0$. More specifically, the coordinate of them are (1, $x_i$) and (2,$x_i$) where $1\leq x_i\leq d_1$. If the BV resides in a node in the first column, then all of its clones are destroyed. If the BV resides in a node in the second column, then the elimination phase begins. Let's assume that the we starts at $T_0$. Agents residing in nodes in the second column moves EAST at the beginning of T(2n), $n=0,1, \ldots ,d_2-1$. More precisely, node (x, y) move to (x+1, y) at the beginning of T(2n), $n=0,1, \dots , d_2-1$. Agents residing in the first column simply follow the node in the second column (see  Fig.\ref{fig:TShE}). When one of the node in the former column is destroyed by a BV, the second phase starts.

\noindent{\bf Elimination Phase}
The elimination begins when one of the node in the former column is destroyed by a BV( let's say, at T(2$x_i$)). No matter where is the BV, there are always three agents residing on its north(if the BV is not in the first line), west and south (if the BV is not in the last line), so only one BV clone survives. In another word, only one node becomes BV node after the BV being triggered. Let the node where the surviving clone resided be $(x, y)$ and its situation can be divided into four cases. Different routes of agents in the elimination phase are based on the location of the new formed BV.
\begin{itemize}
\item Case 1: When $2<x<d_1$, $1<y<d_2-1$ (a interior node becomes a new formed BV), then agents (let's say agents $a,b,c$) residing in node $(x-1, y+1)$, $(x-1, y-1)$ and $(x-2, y)$ receive a BV clone at T(2$x_i$+1), so that they know the location of the original BV and also the new formed BV. Note that in the exploring phase, the agents move EAST at T(2n), $n=0,1, \ldots ,d_2-2$. Actually, one unit of time is reserved for some agents to receive the BV clone. After they receive the BV clone, these agents move EAST for one step (for example, to node $(x, y+1)$, $(x, y-1)$ and $(x-1, y)$ and stop. Note that other agents including agents residing in node $(x-2, y+1)$ and $(x-2, y-1)$ (let's say agent d and e) at T(2$x_i$) do not know the existence of the BV so they keep moving EAST. These two agents arrive at nodes $(x, y+1)$, $(x, y-1)$ at T(2($x_i+2$)) and at this time they meet agent $a$ and $b$ respectively. Agent $a$ and $b$ inform them of the location of the new form BV and the routes of agents $d$ and $e$ are as follow:\\
route of $d$: $(x, y+1)(at\ T(2(x_i+2)){\rightarrow}(x+1,y+1)(at\ T(2(x_i+2)+1){\rightarrow}(x+1,y)(at\ T(2(x_i+3))$.\\
route of $e$: $(x, y-1)(at\ T(2(x_i+2)){\rightarrow}(x, y)(at\ T(2(x_i+3)+1))$.
The routes of agents are showed in Fig.\ref{fig:subfigmesh1}.

\item Case 2: When $x=d_1$, $2<y<d_2-1$ (a border node becomes a new formed BV), then agents (let's say agents $a,b,c$) residing in node $(x-1, y+1)$, $(x-1, y-1)$ and $(x-2, y)$ receive a BV clone at T(2$x_i$+1). As above, they move EAST for one step and stop. Agents residing in nodes $(x-2, y+1)$ and $(x-2, y-1)$ (let's say agents $a,b$) at T(2$x_i$) have no knowledge of the BV, so they keep moving and arrive at nodes $(x, y+1)$ and $(x, y-1)$ at T(2($x_i$+2)) when they are informed of the location of the new formed BV. One of agents $a$ and $b$ should move to the new formed BV to decontaminate it while the other one stop moving. In order to avoid conflict, we always employ the agent $a$ to move to the new formed BV.

\item Case 3: When $2<x<d_1$, $y=1$ or $y=d_2-1$ (a border node becomes a new formed BV). For convenience, we only discuss the situation when $y=1$(the solution can be easily modified to fit the scenario when $y=d_2-1$). In this case, agents residing in nodes $(x-1, y+1)$ and $(x-2, y)$ (let's say agents a,b) receive a BV clone at T(2$x_i$+1). Agents $a$ and $b$ move EAST for one step and arrive at node $(x, y+1)$ and node $(x-1, y)$ at T($2(x_i+1)$). Since the number of agents who can be informed of the location of the new formed BV is not enough for decontaminating the BV, we should notify one more agent to participate in the elimination phase. We employ agent $a$ who resides in node $(x, y+1)$ at T(2$x_i$+1) to notify agent residing in node $(x, y+1)$ (let's say agent $c$), so it move NORTH for one step and arrive at node $(x, y+2)$ at T($2(x_i+1)+1$). Then both of agents $a$ and $c$ move SOUTH and reach node $(x, y+1)$ at T($2(x_i+2)$) when the they meet the agent who move from node $(x-1, y+1)$ (let's say agent $d$) and notify it to stop moving. Then agent $a$ move EAST and then SOUTH to reach node $(x+1, y)$ at T($2(x_i+3)$). Finally, at T($2(x_i+3)+1$), agent $d$ move SOUTH to permanently eliminate the BV.
\item Case 4: When $x=d_1$ and $y=1$ or $y=d_2-1$ (a corner node becomes a new formed BV). For convenience, we only discuss the situation when $y=1$. In this case, agents residing in node $(x-1, y+1)$ and $(x-2, y)$ (let's say agents a,b) receive a BV clone at T(2$x_i$+1). Both of them keep moving for one step and arrive at nodes $(x, y+1)$ and $(x-1, y)$ at T$(2(x_i+1))$.
