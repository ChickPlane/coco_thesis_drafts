\begin{center}\textbf{Acknowledgements}\end{center}
Firstly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor Professor Paola Flocchini for her enthusiastic motivation, judicious and enlightening advices, and patient guidance throughout this thesis work!
Prof.Flocchini carefully selected my courses and thesis topics, and at the same time, consistently allowed this thesis to be my own work, but steered me in the right direction whenever she thought I need it. Without her continuous support and encouragement through the process of writing this thesis, it would not be possible for me to complete this work.

Finally, I must express my very profound gratitude to my parents for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement. Without my family's encouragement and support, I would not achieve this.
